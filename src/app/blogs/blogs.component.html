                When people invest in property, they secure a certain future, a certain return. While they are aware of the maintenance costs and legal formalities, it becomes challenging if the property is located hundreds of miles away. There are many landlords in India and abroad who have bought properties in suburban areas and rural areas as their second homes or holiday homes. They may have other objectives such as investment for future occupation or for any other purpose<br>

In fact, Emgee Group announced an investment of Rs 1,600 crore into the affordable housing segment in the next five years.

PE firms such as Essel Finance Advisors, Brick Eagle Capital, Avenue Venture Partners Real Estate, Nisus Finance Services have launched such partnerships.
